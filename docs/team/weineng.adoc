== Summary of contributions

This section summarises the key contributions that I made to the project.

* *Major enhancement*: added the ability to *set and change password to the application* and allow *searching for loans of specific dates*.
** What it does: Allow user to set password and change password for the app, so that critical comments that affects statistical integrity (Transaction summery & Tax-filing) cannot be performed by unauthorised personnel.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because only authorized users are now able use the critical commands (E.g. `delete` command) to delete loans, which affects critical summery including tax-filling, revenue management.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects the security of the application and how existing commands and commands can leverage this in future release. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* *Minor enhancement*:
*Create NRIC class and validate to ensure that only Singapore issued NRIC is provided.
